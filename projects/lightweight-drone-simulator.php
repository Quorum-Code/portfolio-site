            <p class="individual-project-text">
                &nbsp;The simulator was developed during the TaMaLe Research Experience for Undergraduates
                (REU) program 2023. The project I worked on for my 10 weeks with the program was
                under Dr. Tunc, a Computer Engineering professor at the University of North Texas.
                Dr. Tunc wanted us to work on developing a lightweight drone simulator that could
                run faster and therefore require less resources compared to other available drone
                simulators.

                &nbsp;The paper is in the process of being submitted to a conference and is
                therefore still being changed to meet the conference requests. The downloadable
                PDF is the latest version as of 9/27/2023.
