                &nbsp;I made Hamish Hamster for the "Summer Slow Jams June 2021: Exploration". The theme 
                of the Game Jam was exploration and forgotten places. In the game you play as a hamster 
                who can consume and release objects found in the world to solve platformer puzzles. The 
                online Game Jam took place from the 9th to the 21st of June 2021. During that time I made 
                the scripts, art, and music for the game, and finally published the game on itch.io for free.
